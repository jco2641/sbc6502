Starting point for PLC design idea:
http://sbc.rictor.org/decoder.html

This site and page have been linked in discussions a few times.
PLCs are a way to implement complex combinational logic that would ordinarily take tens of logic gates in a single IC.
So I decided to try it.

What I got - Software:
WinCUPL: https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/fpgas-and-plds/splds-cplds/pld-design-resources
Serial number from download page: 60008009
WinCUPL Manual:  http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/doc0737.pdf

Hardware:
22V10 PLD array:  https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=39159
Programmer: I used my TL866II Plus, and the Xgpro software (windows) that came with it.  It looks like the minipro command line also supports writing to PLCs

I've decided to use all 32K of RAM, and take the 64 bytes for 4 VIAs from the low end of ROM.
The memory map I came up with:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dtwUZS-A5DAV1TVMrngq8Xj7K0klu_qNPEEbwgagwu0/edit?usp=sharing
